I used different techniques and tools of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, data analysis, anomaly detection, etc., to create a system that can generate reports and alerts based on the data collected from the network and server monitoring. The system can also provide recommendations and solutions to prevent or fix the errors detected. The system is designed to be scalable, adaptable and user-friendly.
